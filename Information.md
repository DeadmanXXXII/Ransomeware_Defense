With the current V2.py script, here's what you can achieve:

### **1. Network Sniffer:**
- **Purpose:** Captures network traffic to find and extract encryption keys.
- **Implementation:** Uses `scapy` to sniff packets on a specified network interface. It looks for patterns associated with encryption keys in the packet data and sends them to a specified server.

### **2. Memory Analysis and Key Extraction:**
- **Purpose:** Searches through the memory of running processes to find encryption keys.
- **Implementation:** Iterates over processes, reads memory regions, and applies regex patterns to find keys (e.g., AES and RSA keys). Extracted keys are sent to the CISO.

### **3. Library Hooking:**
- **Purpose:** Intercepts functions related to encryption key generation and usage in various libraries.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Fernet:** Hooks into the `generate_key` method to intercept generated keys.
  - **Salsa20:** Hooks into the key generation to intercept Salsa20 encryption keys.
  - **SQL:** Hooks into `sqlite3.connect` to capture any encryption keys passed in connection parameters.
  - **C#:** Uses the `clr` module to hook into .NET encryption methods (e.g., AES encryption).
  - **Java:** Uses Frida to hook into Java applications and intercept encryption-related operations.

### **4. Extendable Library Hooking:**
- **Purpose:** Allows for adding additional hooks for other libraries or encryption methods.
- **Implementation:** Provides examples of how to extend hooks for other Python libraries (e.g., `cryptography`) or .NET applications.

### **5. Custom Memory Scanners:**
- **Purpose:** Scans memory for specific types of encryption keys, such as RSA keys.
- **Implementation:** Searches memory ranges in processes for patterns matching RSA keys and sends them to the CISO.

### **6. Kernel-Level Hooking (Conceptual):**
- **Purpose:** Advanced technique for hooking at the kernel level (conceptual, not implemented in the script).
- **Implementation:** Mentions the need for kernel driver development and related frameworks.

### **7. Key Extraction from Python Libraries:**
- **Purpose:** Extracts keys from Python libraries by intercepting key-related operations.
- **Implementation:** Uses Frida to hook into Java libraries and capture encryption keys.

### **8. Decryption Functions (Example):**
- **Purpose:** Demonstrates how to decrypt files that were encrypted using AES-256.
- **Implementation:** Provides functions to decrypt files and directories of files using a specified key.

### **Overall Capabilities:**
- **Network Monitoring:** Captures and processes encryption keys from network traffic.
- **Memory Scanning:** Analyzes memory for encryption keys from various algorithms.
- **Library Interception:** Hooks into common encryption libraries and frameworks to capture keys.
- **Advanced Features:** Placeholder for kernel-level techniques, with actual implementation needing additional expertise.
- **File Decryption:** Provides an example for decrypting files encrypted with AES-256.

This script is a comprehensive tool for detecting and extracting encryption keys in various environments, useful for testing and security analysis. Adjustments to IP addresses, ports, file paths, and encryption keys will be necessary to tailor it to specific use cases.
